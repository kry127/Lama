-- check function casting (this may cause Cast- fail)
-- we would like smth like:
-- Cast(f, ?, Int->Str, +) @ "kek" -> Cast(f @ Cast("kek", Int, -), Str, +)
-- we would like to trigger Cast-

-- this function work is to convert integer to string
fun intStringer(x :: Int) {

-- declare some dynamic variable:
local dyn :: ? = "This Chad can be anything he wants";
dyn := intStringer; -- TODO make cast not only expression class, but rather value class, see next line
dyn("lel") -- normally, cast would fail, but now...
